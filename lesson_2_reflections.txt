What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It adds a .git file into the directory.
By doing that, it can record the changes of commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is kind of a buffer between working directory and repository. 
It lets you choose which one to commit.
